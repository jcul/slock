slock-pam-rhost-for-nonzero-pw.diff

This patch sets PAM_RHOST to a dummy value, if a password has been entered.
If using fingerprint login, there is no way to tell PAM to skip the fingerprint.
If you want to use password login it is not possible,
For example, because your fingerprint reader is broken, or you burnt your finger
tip.

There are a few ways around this, use a different PAM service file when a
password has been entered, that does not enable fingerprint, use
pam-fprint-grosshack, or simply set RHOST so finerprint will be skipped.

So now if password is empty it will use fingerprint, else it will use password
only.
